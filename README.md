# Doing-It

This was a project I created during yHack March 2018. I had never written anything in Python before(or indeed any language outside of C/C++), and wanted to try and do something basic.

It is a hybrid event-calendar/to-do list that runs in the console. It has CRUD functions for events and tasks. I used the datetime library pretty heavily.
